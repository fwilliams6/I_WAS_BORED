# I_WAS_BORED


Hey, so my name is Fernando.

As of the latest update I'm currently a Seneca Student For Computer Programming and Analysis.
This repository is mearly for codes that I do when I'm bored and feel like building something new. 
A lot of these aren't very complex but they are helpful. I have some bash scritps that are very helpful during School.


If you found these repository and hope it is helpful to you as well and feel free to comment if there are any updates that you would like, I'm always willing to learn and expand.
